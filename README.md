üå± Soil Moisture Detector
 Overview
This Arduino-based Soil Moisture Detector monitors soil moisture levels and controls a water pump automatically. It displays real-time moisture percentage on an LCD screen and includes a buzzer alert when the pump is activated.

 Features
 Automatic Soil Moisture Monitoring (0-100%)
 Smart Water Pump Control (Turns ON/OFF based on dryness)
 LCD Display for Real-Time Updates
 Buzzer Alert System for Pump Activation
 Water Conservation & Efficient Irrigation

 Components Required
Arduino Uno/Nano
Soil Moisture Sensor
16x2 LCD Display
Water Pump
Buzzer
Connecting Wires & Power Supply
 How It Works
1Ô∏è The moisture sensor measures soil moisture and sends data to Arduino.
2Ô∏è The LCD display shows the current moisture percentage.
3Ô∏è If the soil is too dry, the pump turns ON and waters the soil.
4Ô∏è A buzzer alert sounds when irrigation starts.
5Ô∏è Once moisture is sufficient, the pump turns OFF automatically.

 Applications
 Home Gardens & Smart Farming
 Automated Irrigation Systems
 Water Conservation Projects
